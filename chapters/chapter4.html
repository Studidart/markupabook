    <h1>Chapter IV: The Road Through the Forest</h1>
    <p>After a few hours, the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult that the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were very uneven. Sometimes they were broken or missing altogether, leaving holes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. The Scarecrow, having no brains, walked straight ahead, stepping into the holes and falling flat on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy would pick him up and set him on his feet again, both laughing merrily at his mishap.</p>

    <p>The farms were not nearly as well cared for here as they were farther back. There were fewer houses and fruit trees, and the further they went, the more dismal and lonesome the country became.</p>

    <p>At noon, they sat down by the roadside near a little brook. Dorothy opened her basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he refused.</p>

    <p>“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am not, for my mouth is only painted, and if I cut a hole in it to eat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, spoiling the shape of my head.”</p>

    <p>Dorothy nodded and continued eating her bread.</p>

    <p>“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,” said the Scarecrow after her lunch. She told him all about Kansas, how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her to this queer Land of Oz.</p>

    <p>The Scarecrow listened carefully and said, “I cannot understand why you would wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place you call Kansas.”</p>

    <p>“That is because you have no brains,” answered the girl. “No matter how dreary our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any beautiful country. There is no place like home.”</p>

    <p>The Scarecrow sighed. “Of course I cannot understand it. If your heads were stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the beautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate for Kansas that you have brains.”</p>

    <p>“Won’t you tell me a story while we are resting?” asked the child.</p>

    <p>The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully. “My life has been so short that I really know nothing. I was only made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time is unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first things he did was paint my ears, so I could hear. The first thing I heard was the farmer saying, ‘How do you like those ears?’”</p>

    <p>“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.</p>

    <p>“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are ears just the same,’” which was true enough.</p>

    <p>“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So he painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished, I found myself looking at him and everything around me with great curiosity; this was my first glimpse of the world.</p>

    <p>“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the Munchkin. “‘Blue paint is just the color for eyes.’</p>

    <p>“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’” said the farmer. When the second eye was done, I could see much better than before. Then he made my nose and mouth, but I did not speak because at that time I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had fun watching them make my body and limbs, and when they fastened on my head, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.</p>

    <p>“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the farmer. ‘He looks just like a man.’”</p>

    <p>“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield and set me up on a tall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon walked away and left me alone.</p>

    <p>“I did not like being deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them, but my feet wouldn’t touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole. It was a lonely life, for I had nothing to think of, having been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield, but when they saw me, they flew away, thinking I was a Munchkin; this pleased me and made me feel important. An old crow flew near me and perched on my shoulder, saying:</p>

    <p>“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any crow of sense could see you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then he hopped down and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds, seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so soon there was a great flock about me.</p>

    <p>“I felt sad, for it showed I was not a good Scarecrow after all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had brains in your head, you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter if one is a crow or a man.’</p>

    <p>“After the crows left, I thought this over and decided I would try hard to get some brains. By good luck, you came along and pulled me off the stake, and from what you say, I’m sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon as we reach the Emerald City.”</p>

    <p>“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious to have them.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”</p>

    <p>“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the basket to the Scarecrow.</p>

    <p>There were no fences by the roadside now, and the land was rough and untilled. Toward evening, they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so big and close that their branches met over the yellow brick road. It was almost dark under the trees, as the branches shut out the daylight; but the travelers did not stop and went on into the forest.</p>

    <p>“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow, “and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go wherever it leads us.”</p>

    <p>“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.</p>

    <p>“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow. “If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said it.”</p>

    <p>After an hour or so, the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some dogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well as by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.</p>

    <p>“If you see any house or place to pass the night,” she said, “you must tell me; it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark.”</p>

    <p>Soon after, the Scarecrow stopped. “I see a little cottage to our right,” he said, “built of logs and branches. Shall we go there?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired out.”</p>

    <p>So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage. Dorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at once, and with Toto beside her, soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who was never tired, stood in another corner and waited patiently until morning came.</p>
